### About me





I grew up around Albany, New York and moved out to Los Angeles to attend UCLA. During my time at UCLA, I studied economics, international development, and geospatial information systems and worked on several research projects. In my post-baccalaureate career, I had the privilege of working as an intern with NASA, a research assistant with StudyLA at Loyola Marymount University, and research analyst for the Institute for Applied Economics at Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation; in these roles, I employed economic, demographic, survey, and spatial research methods to provide insights to policymakers around policy design, implementation, and impact in policy areas ranging from digital equity to voter engagement. Immediately before coming to Berkeley, I served as Peace Corps Response Volunteer in The Gambia, assisting the Department of Agriculture staff with designing and implementing a monitoring and evaluation system for horticultural production.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking meals for my friends and family, trying to make the perfect cup of drip coffee, volunteering around food access issues, doing crossword puzzles, and getting into nature.





### Research interests





I am interested in using spatial, community-engaged qualitative, and an array of quantitative methods to provide research around the following areas of U.S. urban policy:

* Housing (land use, economic/racial segregation, issues around affordability)
* Social welfare
* Racial inequality



My work is guided by my values, which center kindness towards others, restorative justice, and a hopefulness for how public policy can shape a better world.
